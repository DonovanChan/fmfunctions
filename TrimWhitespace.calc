NAME:	TrimCR ( text )
PURPOSE:	Removes leading and trailing carriage returns from text.
EXAMPLES:
	TrimCR ( "¶¶text¶" ) = "text"
NOTES:
	This method has been found to be faster than several other methods:
	- Substituting returns out for spaces and using Trim()
	- Testing left-most and right-most characters recursively
