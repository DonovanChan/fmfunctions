NAME:
	ErrorText ( errorNum )

PURPOSE:
	Returns descriptions for codes from FileMaker 10 help text (see http://www.filemaker.com/help/html/error_codes.html#1027502).  Very useful is displaying errors to users and reporting in logs to make the codes intelligible.
	Note that a negative value is possible (-1), so checks for healthy errors should always take this form:
		Case ( $_error = 0	; "Healthy"	; "Unhealthy" )

EXAMPLES:
	ErrorText ( 112 ) = "Window is missing"
